Project Goal: Breathe-EZ is an automatic BVM (Bag-Valve-Mask) system designed to read the maximum air pressure of the patients lung, adjust wall modulation compressing the bag and delivering an accurate and safe amount air to the patient until a parametic is available for assistance.

This code is the demonstration code used for the final presentation. Ideally, this code would change modulations based on the pressure reading from the patient but since this cannot be tested on a real patient until years of testing, a set modulation is implemented, reading and displaying the amount of pressure and able to display a warning message when the margin for error has been surpassed.
